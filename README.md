[*] Since the original code of DaSiamRPN is for Python2, We had to modify the code a little bit to be compatible with Python3.  
[**] The author's new ECO is used. You still can use previous ECO with ECO_prev.  
[***] The version of scipy should be under 1.1.0 because MDNet need to use imresize function.

## Datasets

* [OTB2015](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7001050)[<http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/index.html>]
* [NFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05884)[<http://ci2cv.net/nfs/index.html>]
* [UAV123](https://ivul.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/pub-benchmark-simulator-uav.aspx)[<https://uav123.org/>]
* [TColor128](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7277070)[<http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~hbling/data/TColor-128/TColor-128.html>]
* [VOT2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-11009-3_1)[<http://www.votchallenge.net/>][*]
* [LaSOT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07845)[<https://cis.temple.edu/lasot/download.html>]

[*] VOT2018 is evaluated in unsupervised experiment as same as other datasets.

## Frameworks

* pytracking[<https://github.com/visionml/pytracking>] for tracking datasets.
* pysot-toolkit[<https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit>] for evaluating trackers.

## Requirements

```sh
conda create -n [ENV_NAME] python=[PYTHON_VERSION>=3.6]
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=[CUDA_VERSION] -c pytorch
pip install ortools opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```

## How to run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/songheony/AAA-journal
mkdir AAA-journal/external
cd AAA-journal/external
git clone [EXPERT_GIT]
bash run_experts.sh
bash run_algorithms.sh
bash run_evaluations.sh
```

1. Clone this repository and make external directory.

2. Clone experts who you want to hire.

3. Run the experts.

4. Run algorithms what you want. [*]

5. Evaluate the trackers.

[*] The code is supposed to run algorithms after running experts for test. However, it is not difficult to modify the code to do both simultaneously.
